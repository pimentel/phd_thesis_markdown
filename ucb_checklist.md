Lifted from [here](http://grad.berkeley.edu/academic-progress/dissertation/#formatting-your-manuscript)

## Formatting your manuscript

All manuscripts must be submitted electronically in a traditional PDF format.

- [x] Page Size: The standard for a document’s page size is 8.5 x 11 inches. If compelling reasons exist to use a larger page size, you must contact the Graduate Division for prior approval.

### Appearance & Typeface:

- [x] Basic manuscript text must  be a non-italic type font and at a size of 12-point or larger. Whatever typeface and size you choose for the basic text, use it consistently throughout your entire manuscript. **in the grunt file or makefile**
- [x] For footnotes, figures, captions, tables, charts, and graphs, a font size of 8-point or larger is to be used.
- [x] You may include color in your dissertation, but your basic manuscript text must be black.
- [x] For quotations, words in a foreign language, occasional emphasis, book titles, captions, and footnotes, you may use italics. A font different from that used for your basic manuscript may be used for appendices, charts, drawings, graphs, and tables.

### Pagination: Your manuscript is composed of preliminary pages and the main body of text and references.

- [ ] Page numbers must be positioned either in the upper right corner, lower right corner, or the bottom center and must be at least ¾ of an inch from the edges. The placement of the page numbers in your document must be consistent throughout.
- [x] Be Careful! If you have any pages that are rotated to a landscape orientation, the page numbers still need to be in a consistent position throughout the document (as if it were printed and bound).
- [x] Do not count or number the title page, the approval (signature) page, or the copyright page. All other pages must have numbers. DO NOT SKIP PAGE ” 1 “.
- [x] The remaining preliminary pages may include a table of contents, a dedication, a list of figures, tables, symbols, illustrations, or photographs, a preface, your introduction, acknowledgments, and curriculum vitae. You must number these preliminary pages using lower case Roman numerals beginning with the number “i” and continue in sequence to the end of the preliminary pages (i, ii, iii, iv, v, etc.).
- [x] Your abstract must have Arabic numeral page numbers. Start numbering your abstract with the number “1” and continue in sequence (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- [x] The main body of your text and your references also use Arabic numerals. Start the numbering of the main body with the number “1” and continue in sequence (1, 2, 3, etc.), numbering consecutively throughout the rest of the text, including illustrative materials, bibliography, and appendices.
- [x] Yes! The first page of your abstract and the first page of your main text both start with ‘1’

### Margins: For the manuscript material, including headers, footers, tables, illustrations, and photographs, all margins must be at least 1 inch from the edges of the paper. Page numbers must be ¾ of an inch from the edge.

- [x] Spacing: Your manuscript must be single-spaced throughout, including the abstract, dedication, acknowledgments, and introduction.
- [ ] Tables, charts, and graphs may be presented horizontally or vertically and must fit within the required margins. Labels or symbols are preferred rather than colors for identifying lines on a graph.
- [ ] You may choose to reduce the size of a page to fit within the required margins, but be sure that the resulting page is clear and legible.

Guidelines for Mixed Media: please see Appendix B for details.

## Special Page Formats
